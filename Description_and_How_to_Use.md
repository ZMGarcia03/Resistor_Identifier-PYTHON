# Resistor_Identifier-PYTHON

This Python script calculates the resistance of a resistor based on its color bands. The user inputs the colors of the first two bands and the multiplier band, and the script outputs the resistance value in ohms.

## Python Implementation (resistor_color_code.py)

- **File Extension:** `.py`
- **Dependencies:** None

- **Usage:**
  1. **Save the Code:**
     - Save the provided [`Python code`](resistor_color_code.py) to a file named `resistor_color_code.py`.

  2. **Run the Script:**
     - Open a terminal or command prompt.
     - Navigate to the directory where the `resistor_color_code.py` file is saved.
     - Run the script using the following command:
       ```sh
       python resistor_color_code.py
       ```

  3. **Enter Band Colors:**
     - When prompted, enter the colors of the first two bands and the multiplier band of the resistor.

  4. **View Result:**
     - The script will calculate and display the resistance value in ohms.

## Example:

```sh
Resistor Color Code Calculator
Enter the color of the bands:
First band: red
Second band: violet
Multiplier band: yellow
The resistance value is: 270000.00 ohms
```

In this example, the program calculates that a resistor with a red, violet, and yellow color code has a resistance of 270,000 ohms (270 kilo-ohms).

This Python-based resistor color code calculator is a quick and easy tool to determine the resistance value of resistors based on their color bands.


### How to Use the Python Script

1. **Save the Code:**
   - Copy the Python code provided above and save it in a file named `resistor_color_code.py`.

2. **Run the Script:**
   - Open your terminal or command prompt.
   - Navigate to the directory where you saved the `resistor_color_code.py` file.
   - Run the script using the following command:
     ```sh
     python resistor_color_code.py
     ```

3. **Enter Band Colors:**
   - When prompted, enter the colors of the first two bands and the multiplier band of the resistor.

4. **View Result:**
   - The script will output the resistance value in ohms.

By following these steps, you can easily calculate the resistance value of resistors based on their color bands using this Python script.
